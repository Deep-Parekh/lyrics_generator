[Verse 1]
My prom dress
 its like i couldnt breathe
 and it wouldve been you
 ive got a boyfriend hes older than us
 but ive got
 and now im your baby your baby
 but you cut through like a priceless wine
 the whole scene
 good thing estes sisters gon na come if youre bad
 then you wont remember all my potential
 and you love the players
 and a sweater
 well move to india forever
 flew in all her bitch pack friends from the dead i do next
 this pain wouldnt be for
 evermore
 evermore
 this is me trying
 and im so furious
 at her job or anywhere
 h? reports
[Chorus]

 every time
cause we never go away
 my smoking gun
 my sleepless night
 you make your way through the garden
 in the pub we are watching rugby with his school friends
 show me a reason
 x marks the spot where we fell apart
 my broken drum
 you drew stars around my dear
 have i known you twenty seconds or twenty years
 and then canceled my plans just in case youd call
 back when i was a work of art
[Verse 2]
Promise that youll never be the man yeah
 call it what you want yeah
 i got wasted like all my potential
 and if i just cant prove it
 wheres that man whod throw blankets over my barbed wire
 chains around my scars
 but not for me it was my season for battle wounds
 battle scars body bumped bruised
 stabbed in the back of the gym
 i close my eyes and the ballet
 and youll never find another like
 me e e ooh ooh
 youre touchin me
 butcause he really knows me
 ooh look what youve done
 ’cause baby now weve got bad blood hey
 now im right ? down ? in
[Chorus]

 every time
cause we never go away
 my smoking gun
 my sleepless night
 you make your way through the garden
 in the pub we are watching rugby with his school friends
 show me a reason
 x marks the spot where we fell apart
 my broken drum
 you drew stars around my dear
 have i known you twenty seconds or twenty years
 and then canceled my plans just in case youd call
 back when i was a work of art
[Outro]
My god look at how my tears ricochet
 anywhere else is hollow
 im only seventeen i dont think its in the pub we are again when i felt like i was a man if i could write my name wishing i stayed
 look what you want call it what you just made me do
 look what you want call it what you want yeah
 you put me together again
cause if i could never give you my wild give you the best of times the worst thing you ever walk away
 drunk under a streetlight
 you couldnt keep it in
 but if i was a man talks shit then i owe him nothing
 but i just wanted you
